# xchan 🕶️  
**A Chrome extension that anonymizes Twitter/X to reduce groupthink.**

This extension hides all identity-based social signals on Twitter/X by replacing usernames with anonymized hashed IDs, hiding profile photos, and removing likes, retweets, and view counts. It lets you engage with content based on merit — not metrics.

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 Replaces all visible usernames and handles with consistent hashed IDs
- 📷 Hides all profile photos (avatars)
- 📉 Removes like, retweet, and view counts
- 🧼 Cleans up the Twitter/X UI for distraction-free reading
- ♾️ Works dynamically with infinite scroll, detail views, and sidebars
